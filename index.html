          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Cristiano Ronaldo:</h3>

            <li><strong>1985</strong> - Born in Funchal, Ilha da Madeira, Portugal</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1995</strong> - He went to Clube Desportivo Nacional and his success with the team led him to sign with Sporting Clube de Portugal for two seasons and managed to become the only player to have played for Sporting under-16, under-17, under-18, B, and in the first team, all in one season.
            </li>

I said 28. But Ferguson said, 'No, you're going to get number 7,' and the famous shirt was an extra source of motivation. They were forced to live up to an honor".
